This guide covers how to start different inference engines with various configurations using Inference Engine Arena.

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for starting an engine is:

```bash
# Start an engine
arena start <engine_type> <model_name_or_path> [engine_args]
```

Where:

- `<engine_type>` is the type of engine (e.g., `vllm`, `sglang`)
- `<model_name_or_path>` is either a Hugging Face model ID or ~~a local path(currently not supported)~~ to a model
- `[engine_args]` are arguments passed directly to the underlying engine, which is compatible to anything after `vllm serve`

## Environment Variables(optional)

Before starting an engine, you can set environment variables to configure advanced behaviors. These are set using standard shell commands:

```bash
# Example setting environment variables before starting an engine
export VLLM_USE_V1=1
export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
```

## Starting vLLM

<Accordion title="Basic Usage" defaultOpen>
  ```bash
  arena start vllm NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --enable-prefix-caching
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Options" defaultOpen>
  ```bash
  # Start vLLM with environment variables and engine arguments
  export VLLM_USE_V1=1
  export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"
  export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
  arena start vllm NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --enable-prefix-caching --quantization fp8
  ```
</Accordion>

## Starting SGLang

<Accordion title="Basic Usage" defaultOpen>
  ```bash
  arena start sglang NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --chunked-prefill-size 2048
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Options" defaultOpen>
  ```bash
  # Start sglang with environment variables and engine arguments
  export SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM=1
  export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"
  export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
  arena start sglang NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --enable-torch-compile
  ```
</Accordion>

## Managing Running Engines

<Accordion title="Listing Engines" defaultOpen>
  To see the status of all running engines:

  ```bash
  arena list
  ```

  This will show the engine type, container ID, model, status, and endpoint for each engine.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Viewing Logs" defaultOpen>
  To view the logs of a running engine:

  ```bash
  # Show recent logs
  arena logs vllm
  
  # Follow logs in real-time
  arena logs vllm --follow
  
  # View a specific number of lines
  arena logs vllm --tail 500
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stopping Engines" defaultOpen>
  To stop a running engine:

  ```bash
  # Stop by engine type
  arena stop vllm
  ```
</Accordion>
